			Today, I am starting a more in depth study of the priesthood, to try to better understand exactly what it is. I can give standard Sunday School answers, but I want to better understand this. Specifically, there are few things that come to mind:

			Some things that we may attribute to the priesthood can also apply to women or others outside the church that do not "hold" it. (E.g., revelation and knowing the mind of God)
			If the priesthood is inseparably connected with the powers of heaven, in other words, God's power always does what He intends, then what role do we have with it?
			We get the chance to be a part of the process.

			One thing pertaining to the priesthood is the ability to officiate in ordinances and in church matters. This is where the authority of the priesthood is critical. It needs to be done by those who have authority and it is known to the church that they have authority.

			The authority of the priesthood allows us to participate in ordinances and business, what does the power actually entail?

			There are two priesthoods in the church (Doc. &amp; Cov. 107:1).

			"All other authorities or offices in the church are appendages to this priesthood." (v. 5) - Thus any office or authority of any type in the church is an "appendage" to the priesthood. Google defines appendage to be "a thing that is added or attached to something larger or more important." I'm not sure if this means they are included, or encircled somehow, by the priesthood, or if they are separate, but somehow "report back" to the priesthood. Or perhaps merely that they derive their authority from the priesthood. This las idea would seem to be the most in line with Elder Oaks' talk in priesthood recently.

			v.12 "The high priest and elder are to administer in spiritual things"
			v.14 The Aaronic priesthood "has power in administering outward ordinances"

			From v. 18-19, the power and authority of the Melchizedek Priesthood is to:
			* hold the keys of all the spiritual blessings of the church
			* have the privilege of receiving the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven
			* have the heavens opened unto them
			* commune with the general assembly and church of the Firstborn
			* enjoy the communion and presence of God the Father, and Jesus the mediator or the new covenant

			From v. 20, the power and authority of the Aaronic Priesthood is to:
			* hold the keys of the ministering of angels
			* administer in outward ordinances, defined here as:
			* the letter of the gospel
			* the baptism of repentance for the remission of sins, agreeable to the covenants and commandments

			In continuing to study about the priesthood, today I studied Acts chapter 8, where the account is given about Simon, the sorcerer, who wanted to buy the Priesthood. And a few things stood out.

			First, it is clear from Acts 8:16, that there is a difference between the preaching and priesthood of Philip, where only baptism was performed, and that of the Apostles, where the Holy Ghost was bestowed.

			Second, it is interesting in Acts 8:15 that the Apostles prayed for the people to receive the Holy Ghost, before they laid their hands on them. Seeking and receiving the Holy Ghost is more involved than simply performing the ordinance. The people need to be humble, repentant, and truly seek this blessing, and I think that is what Peter and John were praying for.

			But another, perhaps greater lesson about the priesthood is also seen in this chapter. In Acts 8:9, it talks about the "miracles" that Simon did by sorcery, "giving out that himself was some great one". Then in Acts 8:19, Simon says "give _me_ also this power, that on whomsover _I_ lay hands, he may receive the Holy Ghost".

			Maybe it wasn't said this way, but the personal pronouns "me" and "I" stand out to me here. They seem an echo of Lucifer's statement, "Give me thine honor" (see Isaiah 14:12-14, and D&amp;C 29:36, Moses 4:1), and also even of the time that Moses spake unadvisedly, saying "he" had made water come out of the rock (see Psalms 106:33, Numbers 20:10, and Deut 4:21). In my opinion, Simon is seeking for the priesthood, and the power of God for his own pride, and to be something great of himself (see D&amp;C 121). In response, Peter says that his money will perish with him, "for they heart is not right in the sight of God." (Acts 8:21).

			It also makes me think of the line from Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade, "Why do you seek the cup of Christ? Is it for His glory, or for yours?" -- truly, as we seek blessings of the gospel and the power of God in our lives, we should be seeking it for God's glory, and to bless the lives of others, NOT so that we can be a big deal.

			Principle: Priesthood requires humility.

			Continuing my study of the Priesthood, today I was reading from Abraham chapter 1.

			The single verse of Abr 1:2 is just packed with information:

			* "Finding there was greater happiness and peace and rest for me" - Abraham saw what his father and others had in their lives, and he saw the blessings of the Gospel, and recognized how much more happiness he would have with the Gospel.
			* "I sought for the blessings of the fathers" - After he recognized the increased joy, he truly sought for it. Without diligently seeking, he would not have obtained these blessings, but because he did, he found them. (see Matt 7:7 - "seek and ye shall find", but also, 1 Nephi 10:19 - "For he that diligently seeketh shall find; and the mysteries of God shall be unfolded unto them, by the power of the Holy Ghost")
			* "and the right whereunto I should be ordained to administer the same" - He didn't just seek for the blessings for himself, but he wanted to be able to give these blessings to others. Contrast this with Simon's desire for the priesthood in Acts chapter 8, Abraham's is a pure motive.
			* "having been myself a follower of righteousness" - He had been faithful to this point
			* "desiring also to be one who possessed great knowledge" - He wanted to know the mysteries of God. Sometimes in the church, we have a negative feeling associated with this, like "you shouldn't worry about this". Abraham truly wanted to know these mysteries, and this is a good thing!
			* "and to be a greater follower of righteousness" - He wanted to be better. I think this is so critical in connection with the last point. He didn't just want to have greater knowledge for the sake of "knowing", he wanted to know this for the sake of changing his life and being a better disciple. I think this is so important, and where many of us fall down.
			* "and to possess a greater knowledge" - Hmm similar to #5, but this time it says a greater knowledge. I'm not sure if this really means anything specifically, or if it is just reiterating the point.

			Pattern:

			* Recognize the blessings of the Gospel
			* Desire and seek for these blessings (for self)
			* Seek to bless others
			* Be faithful to current knowledge
			* Desire to know the mysteries of God
			* Desire to be a better disciple of God
